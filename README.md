## DataSet

CASIA WebFace DataSet, 494,414 faces over 10,575 identities.

## Dependencies
- PyTorch 1.0.0

## Usage

### Data wrangling
Extract images, scan them, to get bounding boxes and landmarks:
```bash
$ python pre_process.py
```

Image alignment:
1. Face detection(MTCNN).
2. Face alignment(similar transformation).
3. Central face selection.
4. Resize -> 112x112.

### Train
```bash
$ python train.py
```

To visualize the training processï¼š
```bash
$ tensorboard --logdir=runs
```

## Performance evaluation

### DataSet
Use Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset for performance evaluation:

- 13233 faces
- 5749 identities
- 1680 identities with >=2 photo

Download LFW database put it under data folder:
```bash
$ wget http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/lfw-funneled.tgz
$ wget http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/pairs.txt
$ wget http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/people.txt
```

### Get it started

```bash
$ python lfw_eval.py
```

### Results
Backbones|LFW(%)|
|---|---|
|SE-LResNet152E-IR|99.43%|
|SE-LResNet152E-IR|99.38%|
|SE-LResNet101E-IR|99.27%|
